-site
Tells Google to show you results from a certain site only, ex. search: print site:python.org.

-inurl
Searches for pages with a URL that match the search string, ex. inurl:"/course/jumpto.php" site:example.com.

-intitle
Finds specific strings in a page’s title. This is useful because it allows you
to find pages that contain a particular type of content. For example,
file-listing pages on web servers often have index of in their titles, ex. intitle:"index of" site:example.com.

-link
Searches for web pages that contain links to a specified URL. ex. link:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoS".

-filetype
Searches for pages with a specific file extension. ex. filetype:log site:example.com.

-Wildcard (*)
You can use the wildcard operator (*) within searches to mean any char-
acter or series of characters. 

-Quotes (" ")
Adding quotation marks around your search terms forces an exact match.

-Or (|)
The or operator is denoted with the pipe character (|) and can be used
to search for one search term or the other, or both at the same time.
The pipe character must be surrounded by spaces. ex. "how to hack" site:(reddit.com | stackoverflow.com). 

-Minus (-)
The minus operator (-) excludes certain search results. For example,
let’s say you’re interested in learning about websites that discuss hacking,
but not those that discuss hacking PHP, ex. "how to hack websites" -php.

-Kibana 
Is a data visualization tool that displays server operation data such
as server logs, debug messages, and server status. A compromised Kibana
instance can allow attackers to collect extensive information about a site’s
operation. Many Kibana dashboards run under the path app/kibana, so this
query will reveal whether the target has a Kibana dashboard. You can then
try to access the dashboard to see if it’s unprotected:
site:example.com inurl:app/kibana

-Google can find company resources hosted by a third party online,
such as Amazon S3 buckets, ex. site:s3.amazonaws.com COMPANY_NAME

-Look for special extensions that could indicate a sensitive file. In addi-
tion to .log, which often indicates log files, search for .php, cfm, asp, .jsp, and
.pl, the extensions often used for script files:

-Check out the Google Hacking Database (https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database/), a
website that hackers and security practitioners use to share Google search
queries for finding security-related information.
