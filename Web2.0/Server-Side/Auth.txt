AUTH vuln:


-You can try to enumerate user and password's from:

Different Response Time(Try differnt combination of long-small valid-invalid password-username to figure it out. If there is a vuln you will see it)

Different message error

Different status code


IF BRUTE FORCE IS BLOCKED(or limited) TRY TO:

Try the x-forwarder-for header, or similar headers. If permitted you can try to get a password reset token to your email or bypass IP filter 

Try to auth in your user when brute-forcing, the IP can be restored if you access to a real account

Try to guess different password with a single request, with an array of password's (JSON Format)

Try to guess the limit of request before the suspension of an account. Then try just with that limit.


HTTP basic authentication:

Authorization: Basic-base64(username:password)   Is vulnerable to MITM and brute-force.


---------


Multi-Auth vuln:



-Sometimes the 2FA token is not actually checked and you can redirect (if you do the login) to a personal page like /my-account simply by writing it

-If cookie is assigned, try to change it. If the cookie is checked for know the user that is logging in with the 2FA, you chan change it for bypass the login

-Brute Force the 2FA, you need to do this combined with other steps.

-If the system log you out when you are brute-forcing the 2FA you can create a macro to retry the 2FA login and do a new brute-force


------

Other Methods:


--Try to bruteforce the keep-in user (login) (cookie or header)

--Try to see if you can bypass token for delete an account password, maybe they don't really check the token

--See for error messagge in new password form. If you put your valid password and the error is changed you can bruteforce user's password.(for chall with max attemps on login forms)
