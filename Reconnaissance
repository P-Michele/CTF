Web hacking Reconnaissance:

1: Manually Walking Through the Target

2: Google Dorking

3: Scope Discovery:
  -use WHOIS and Reverse WHOIS(ViewDNS.info), to find person information of the owner of the website
  -nslookup facebook.com  to find the IP
  -Autonomous system numbers identify the owner of an AS. To figure out if a company owns a dedicated IP range, run several IP-to-ASN translations to see if the IP addresses map to a single ASN. command: whois -h whois.cymru.com 157.240.2.20
  -Certificate Parsing, use online databases like crt.sh, Censys, and Cert Spotter to find certifi- cates for a domain
  Subdomain Enumeratio, after the domain enumeration, try to find much sufrace attack as possible with tools like Sublist3r, SubBrute, Amass, and Gobuster can enumerate subdomains automatically with a variety of wordlists and strategies.
  You can use Commonspeak2 or https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/ to gen a wordList. Use sort -u wordlist1.txt wordlist2.txt to delete duplicate items from 2+ wordlists. Altdns is a tool to use for autonomation of subdomain enumeartion when
  you already know some somedomains.
  -Service Enumeration, you can do it by scanning the ports(nmap), Shodan is a tool that you can use for passive scanning. The alternative to Shodan are Censys and Project Sonar.
  -Directory Brute-Forcing, use Dirsearch or Gobuste. Then use a screenshot tool like EyeWitness or Snapperto automatically verify that a page is hosted on each location.
  -Spidering the Site, another way to find directories is using web-crawlers. ZAP/Burp have a built-inweb spider you can us 
  -Third-Party Hosting, If an organization uses Amazon S3, its S3 buckets can contain hidden endpoints, logs, credentials ecc...   You can do it by google dorking: BUCKET.s3.amazonaws.com or s3.amazonaws.com/BUCKET. Otherwise try 
  GrayhatWarfare to do a key-word search of the buckets and Lazys3/Bucket Stream for bruteforce buckets.
  -If you find some bucket, install awscli and try to access the buckets,(aws s3 ls s3://BUCKET_NAME). If this works see if you can read the contents of any interesting files bycopying files to your local machine
  -GitHub Recon: if you can find some KEY, secret, password... paste it into KeyHacks to check that the credentials are valid. You can use Gitrob and TruffleHog to autonomate the Github Recon
  -Others: search for employees on Linkedin, ads for finding new software personnel(required skills are used to structure the site). 
  Search for the company on Pastebin and use PasteHunter to see if there are any leaks, otherwise try WayBackMachine and use the tool: https://github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls/ to automate the extraction of endpointsSearch the
