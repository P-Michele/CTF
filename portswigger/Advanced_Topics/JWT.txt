In JWT we can try to:

-Change "alg" in the header to "none". It's a debugging feature that if is enable permits to validate JWT tokne without the signature

-Change the "alg" type. For example if a web app uses RSA in it's alg parameters, you can try to change it to HMAC. RSA uses 2 keys, one public and one private, HMAC instead uses only one secret key.
After changing the algorithm  type you can sign the JWT with the public RSA key. If there is a vulnerability, HMAC will decode the token with your public key, bypassing the purpose of the token.

-Brute-Forcing the Key

-Reading Sensitive Information
