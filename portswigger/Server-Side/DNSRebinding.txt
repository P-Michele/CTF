In DNS rebinding attack, an attacker creates a malicious website and publishes it on the Internet. 
This website contains code that exploits a browser vulnerability,
which allows a domain name to be bound (rebind) to a different IP address. 
Initially, the malicious website provides a short-lived DNS response (TTL) that points to an IP address
controlled by the attacker himself.

The browser then loads the content of the malicious website, which includes JavaScript code that is executed on the user's computer.
The JavaScript code makes a second attempt at DNS resolution to the same domain name, but this time the attacker changes the address
IP associated with it to a local IP address on the user's network.

Since the browser still has the original DNS response cached with a short TTL,
the second DNS resolution attempt is resolved immediately using the cached response, 
pointing to the local IP address. This allows the attacker to communicate with the user's device on the local network,
bypassing browser security restrictions that normally prevent direct access to network resources.

DNS Rebinding allows SOP and CORS(cross-origin resource sahring) to be bypassed.
